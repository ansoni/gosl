# Steam Locamotive - Go Port

A Go port of Toyoda Masahi's (Steam Locomotive)[https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl].

# Why do this?

Wanted a steam locomotive in my command line (as an easter egg).

I didn't add all of the ascii trains, but left them commented out for later work.  Feel free to do that work if ya want:-/
